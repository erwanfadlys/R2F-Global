    <p>The <strong>R2F Submission Tracker</strong> is a versatile business application designed to meet the unique requirements of managing Repair-to-Field (R2F) equipment submissions. Here's an overview of its key aspects:</p>

    <h3>Data Sources</h3>
    <p>The app relies on multiple data sources, each serving a specific region, to ensure data segregation and minimize synchronization issues. These data sources include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Equipment Mapping:</strong> Contains critical mapping information.</li>
        <li><strong>AP Table:</strong> Records specific to the Asia-Pacific region.</li>
        <li><strong>MENA Table:</strong> Records for the Middle East and North Africa.</li>
        <li><strong>EESSA Table:</strong> Records for Eastern Europe, South Asia, and Africa.</li>
        <li><strong>NAL Table:</strong> Records for North America and Latin America.</li>
